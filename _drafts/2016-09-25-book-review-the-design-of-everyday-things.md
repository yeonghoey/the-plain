# Why read?
Faced lots of recommendations from programming books and blog posts,
even though it's a design book.


# The Paradox of Technology

> The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each
> device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to
> use.  This is the paradox of technology and the challenge for the designer.


## Affordances, Signifiers and Constraints

Concepts for making things hard to fail.
Here are definitions about **affordances** and **signifiers**:

- **Affordances** are the possible interactions between people and the 
environment.
- Perceived **affordances** often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous.
- **Signifiers** signal things what actions are possible and how they should be
done.
- **Signifiers** must be perceivable.

> A door **affords** opening.  
> It also **affords** being smashed.  
> The door's knob **signifies** opening.  
> The knob **signifies** whether pushed, pulled, or slid.

**Contraints** work for making things hard to fail.  And **affordances** and
**signifiers** is essential for designing **constraints**.

> The iron plate on a door **signifies** opening by pusing.  
> The iron plate also places a **contraint** of pulling.

These concepts are reminicent of interfaces and encapsulations in programming.
A well designed interface **signifies** how to use the library properly.   It
also hides not intended **affordances** by encapsulations.  It places
**constraints** for making things hard to fail.
