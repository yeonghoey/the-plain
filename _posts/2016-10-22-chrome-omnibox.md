Omnibox is a nickname for Chrome's address bar.
As you know, you can search on Google in there
when you put text other than URLs.

Incidentally, **did you know that you can search on whatever search engine
you like in there?** Let me explain how to.

## Search engines Configuration

Open *Search engines* menu:  
![Guide1]({{ site.url }}/assets/omnibox-guide1.jpg)


A window like following will show up:  
![Guide2]({{ site.url }}/assets/omnibox-guide2.jpg)


There are 3 columns in the *Other search engines* section.
Each values signify `Name`, `Keyword` and `Search String` respectively.
